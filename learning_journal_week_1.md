# Week 1 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I;
* Attended the weekly seminar, 
* Watched/Engaged in the "Lecture Recording 01 - Intro & Web Design Review", 
* Completed the revision test (and re-learned everything on it), 
* Watched the suggested LinkedIn Learning resource (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development-14628245/)
* Got started with Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
* Published to Web Hosting using GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)

## Estimated Hours
I spent about 13 hours of my own time this week learning this subject (consisting of on-campus classes and self-study)

## Content Insights
I re-learned that HTML is used to define the structures of web pages consisting of various elements and attributes.
I also re-learned that CSS is used to style and format a webpage and their associated elements.
Separation of HTML and CSS is important because it improves code organization, readability, and maintainability.

I learned that JavaScript has nothing to do with Java and thus, I should treat it as a new programming language.

I learned to use frameworks (such as Bootstrap) to significantly speed up the time I spent on development.

I learned how to set up and use PhpStorm with Git, Git with GitHub, and GitHub with GitHub Pages.
This set-up is important because it allows me to easily edit, upload, and publish any future websites I might build.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I discovered that I did not remember as much as I thought I would have about both HTML and CSS from CP1406 - Web Design
and Development. Consequently, I spent a lot of time revising/reviewing concepts and code so that I could again master 
both HTML and CSS as they form the foundations of web development.

I found that watching lots of videos greatly helped me to understand new content (such as Javascript and frameworks) so
long as I dedicated my full attention to the videos and did not try to multitask or do something else at the same time.

I realised that I tried to learn absolutely everything I could, even if that meant not meeting deadlines. However, I 
have concluded that this approach to learning is not effective, and that it is more important to finish on time instead 
of learning more than what I necessarily need (in an attempt to be perfect).
