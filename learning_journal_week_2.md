## Estimated Hours
I spent about 10 hours of my time this week learning this subject (not including time I spent; setting up Joomla, troubleshooting, and working on the assignment)

## Content Insights
I learned that Content Management Systems (CMS) play a vital role in modern web development, and that I should learn how to use them effectively.

I learned how platforms like Joomla and WordPress provide a structured way to manage website content, making them essential tools for strong website development.  
I also learned how Joomla interacts with databases (for example, MySQL), allowing for the storage and retrieval of dynamic content.

I learned to set up, configure, and manage a Joomla website in a real hosting environment (for example, the CCP).

I learned to customise both the backend and the frontend of my website (including managing templates, modules, and extensions).
This is essential for building dynamic and scalable websites because it allows for easy future feature expansions.

I learned the in's and out's of deploying a Joomla website on a live server using the CCP on "CloudAccess.net".

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I discovered that I was not yet supposed to be running a localhost of Joomla using Vagrant. Consequently, I spent a lot
of time figuring out, setting up, and troubleshooting the required software (which is still useful for future projects).

I realised that troubleshooting issues is just as important as learning new concepts. However, I did not factor in or 
dedicate an appropriate amount of time to fix the issues that arose (which resulted in unexpected delays in my progress).

I found that watching lots of videos in a row was not very effective as I would retain less information the longer time
went on (even though I dedicated my full attention to the videos). I have concluded that this approach to learning (on its
own) is not effective. In the future, I will spend some time watching videos and then after about an hour, apply my newly
learned information/skills into something practical instead (rather than watch everything to start, followed by practical
application of everything I learned at the end).
